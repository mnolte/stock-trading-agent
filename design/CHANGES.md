# Design changes

Newest first. Each entry names the screens it touches.

## 2026-10-16 — Screenshot instructions

DESIGN.md: PR screenshots are saved in `docs/screenshots/pr-<n>/`, never in `design/`. No screen changes.

## 2026-10-16 — By symbol card

Performance: new "By symbol" card next to "By regime" (closed trades per symbol, best first: trades, won, P&L, average R). Decisions and outcomes now spans the full width. Screenshot updated.

## 2026-10-15 — Flatten question answered

DESIGN.md: Stop & flatten never refuses because of the day-trade rule; the existing warning in the dialog stays. No screen changes.

## 2026-10-15 — Supervised mode wording

Settings: the supervised-mode text now matches the spec — entries only wait for approval, an approval expires at the next cycle and is checked again on approval. DESIGN.md: the approval-expiry question is answered.

## 2026-10-15 — First handoff

All 7 screens: Dashboard, Decision detail, Positions & orders, Performance, LLM inspector, Settings, States and dialogs.

Adapted from the Trading Agent design for stocks:

- Header shows PAPER, the US session state with next-cycle countdown, equity in USD and EUR, today's P&L, the SPY regime and the Kill switch.
- Dashboard: 1h candles with session separators, session VWAP, entry/stop/target lines; watchlist with rules status and earnings dates.
- New Positions & orders screen: bracket legs at Alpaca, reconciliation status, day-trade counter, order history with slippage.
- Performance compares with SPY buy-and-hold, shows raw and adjusted P&L, and scores skips as well as entries.
- States cover session states, broker-side stop and reconciliation banners, PDT guard, earnings data down, and the kill switch, flatten, resume, reset and save dialogs.
- Left out for v0.1: Ask the agent, briefings, reviews, insights, what-if and readiness.
