## 2026-10-15 — First handoff

SPEC.md v0.1 as exported on 15 October 2026. It includes:

- Alpaca paper account only; free data plan (IEX real-time quotes, 15-minute delayed SIP bars).
- 10-symbol universe, long only, whole shares, 1-hour session-aligned bars, six cycles per session at :46.
- Bracket orders with broker-side stops on every position; reconciliation against Alpaca each cycle; PDT guard.
- gpt-4o-mini decision layer with strict JSON output, code checks, and outcome tracking for every decision.
- 14 risk gates, kill switch and Stop & flatten.
- 8-step build plan.

Details settled in this package that SPEC.md does not spell out:

- Environment variables: `MODE`, `SA_HOST`, `SA_PORT`, `SA_DATA_DIR`, `SA_DB_PATH`, plus the four API keys (`.env.example`).
- Every config key and default in `backend/config.example.yaml`.
- Command names: `make install`, `make run`, `make lint`, `make test`; frontend `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck`.
- The full system prompt in `backend/prompts/decision.v1.md`.
