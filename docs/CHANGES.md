Newest first.

## 2026-10-15 — Application timezone

- Overview: new "Timezone" paragraph. The application timezone is Europe/Amsterdam (GUI, logs, alerts, daily jobs); timestamps stay stored in UTC and decision cycles stay on the New York exchange clock.
- `config.example.yaml`: `app.timezone: Europe/Amsterdam`; `schedule.timezone` renamed to `schedule.market_timezone`.

## 2026-10-15 — Trading currency

- Overview: new "Currency" paragraph. All trading, risk limits and stored money values are in US dollars; euro amounts are display only and never used in decisions or risk checks.

## 2026-10-15 — First handoff

SPEC.md v0.1 as exported on 15 October 2026. It includes:

- Alpaca paper account only; free data plan (IEX real-time quotes, 15-minute delayed SIP bars).
- 10-symbol universe, long only, whole shares, 1-hour session-aligned bars, six cycles per session at :46.
